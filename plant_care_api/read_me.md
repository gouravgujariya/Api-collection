# Plant Detection and Care Information API

This project provides an API that detects plant species in an image using the YOLOv8 model and returns care information for the detected plants using a text generation model (`microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct`).

## Features
- Detect plant species in an uploaded image.
- Generate care instructions for the detected plants using a transformer-based text generation model.

## Requirements

To run this API, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7+
- FastAPI
- Uvicorn
- Ultralytics YOLOv8
- Transformers

You can install all dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn ultralytics transformers
```

## YOLOv8 Model
Ensure you have a YOLOv8 model trained to detect plants. You can either train your own model or use a pre-trained one. Place the model's `.pt` file in your project directory or provide the correct path in the code.

## Setup and Run

1. Clone this repository and navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/plant-detection-care-api.git
   cd plant-detection-care-api
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Update the `path_to_your_yolov8_plant_detection_model.pt` in the code with the actual path to your YOLOv8 model.

4. Run the FastAPI application using Uvicorn:

   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

   The API will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## API Endpoints

### Detect Plant
Detects plants in the uploaded image and provides care information.

- **URL**: `/detect-plant`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Body**: `multipart/form-data`
  - `file`: Image file to be analyzed.

#### Example Request (via cURL):
```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://127.0.0.1:8000/detect-plant' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
  -F 'file=@path_to_your_image.jpg'
```

#### Example Response:
```json
{
  "detected_plants": ["Rose", "Tulip"],
  "care_info": {
    "Rose": "To take care of a rose plant, water it regularly and ensure it gets plenty of sunlight...",
    "Tulip": "Tulips require well-drained soil and should be watered sparingly..."
  }
}
```

## Notes
- The YOLOv8 model should be trained specifically for plant detection to return accurate results.
- The transformer model (`microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct`) is used for generating care information. The quality of generated text may vary based on the input.
